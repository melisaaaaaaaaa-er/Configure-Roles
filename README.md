Sign into osTicket using the credentials you input when setting it up. This is the administrator account.

osTicket is divided into the Admin Panel and Agent Panel.

The Admin Panel is where configuration and management osTicket take place (i.e. behind-the-scenes settings and administration). The Agent Panel is where the ticketing operations take place – where help desk users interact with their tickets.

When signing into the system for the first time, you a greeted with the “Tickets” tab on the Agent Panel. This is where the tickets assigned to the respective agent can be found.

Click on the Admin Panel on the top right corner to enter it.

Go to Agents tab → Roles tab.

This is where account roles on osTicket can be configured. There are already some default roles that come pre-made. 

Agents/accounts can be assigned to different roles to meet specific needs and manage access permissions, the same as in an active directory.

Click “Add New Role” on the top right.

Although the default “All Access” role fulfills the same need, we will be creating an “Administrator” role with full permissions as an example of how to create new roles.

Type “Administrator” in the Name section.

Go to the Permissions tab and check off every permission in the list. 

Click “Add Role”.

The new role has now been created.
